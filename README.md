# üëã Welcome to My Corner of the Web!

Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I bring creativity and precision to every project. Let‚Äôs connect and build something amazing together!

## üåü About Me

I‚Äôm Be√°ta N√©meth, a passionate full-stack web developer who thrives on transforming ideas into functional and engaging user experiences. I enjoy collaborating with Agile teams, where challenges become opportunities for innovation.

My journey into tech started with a Ph.D. in neurobiology and biochemistry, followed by a self-directed leap into web development. Guided by the wisdom of a senior IT mentor, I‚Äôve merged my scientific precision with my love for coding to build creative, scalable solutions.

## üí° Skills That Define Me 

‚úî **Systematization & Systems Thinking**: Whether solving a tech challenge or analyzing a dataset, I approach problems with clarity and purpose.  
‚úî **Rapid Learning & Adaptability**: From mastering new frameworks to quirky hobbies like touch-typing with ten fingers, I embrace learning as a lifelong process.  
‚úî **Abstract Thinking**: Breaking down problems, identifying their core, and presenting insights in a clear, concise way is my strength.  
‚úî **Self-Driven & Collaborative**: I thrive in remote environments, value autonomy, and am equally at home in team settings, where innovation flourishes.

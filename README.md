# 👋 Welcome to My Corner of the Web!  

Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I bring creativity and precision to every project. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!  

## 🌟 About Me  

I am a **systems-oriented developer** with a scientific background, focused on the space where software meets infrastructure. My work centers on building reliable, scalable systems that solve real-world problems by bridging the gap between application logic and the cloud.  

Currently, I am leveraging my **full-stack** experience to evolve into **AI Engineering** and **Data Science**. I’m driven by how **cloud-native tools**, and **DevOps** practices can transform intelligent models into production-ready architectures.  

Coming from **neurobiology and biochemistry**, I approach software analytically and experimentally. My technical journey began with the Node.js–MongoDB–React stack and has evolved into **AI-driven systems**, **n8n automations**, **Dockerized services**, and **cloud-based workflows (GCP)**.  


## 🧭 Skills That Define Me 

✔ **Systematization & Systems Thinking**: Whether solving a tech challenge or analyzing a dataset, I approach problems with clarity and purpose.  
✔ **Rapid Learning & Adaptability**: From mastering new frameworks to quirky hobbies like touch-typing with ten fingers, I embrace learning as a lifelong process.  
✔ **Abstract Thinking**: Breaking down problems, identifying their core, and presenting insights in a clear, concise way is my strength.  
✔ **Self-Driven & Collaborative**: I thrive in remote environments, value autonomy, and am equally at home in team settings, where innovation flourishes.

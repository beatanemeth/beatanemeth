# 👋 Welcome to My Corner of the Web!  

Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I bring creativity and precision to every project. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!  

## 🌟 About Me  

I’m a full-stack developer with a scientific background, focused on building reliable and scalable digital systems that solve real-world problems.  

My current interests lie in DevOps and AI engineering—especially automation, cloud-native tools, and modern AI architectures—where I enjoy bridging application development and infrastructure.  

Coming from neurobiology and biochemistry, I approach software systems analytically and experimentally. My journey started with the Node.js–MongoDB–React stack, evolved through Next.js and Firebase, and now includes AI-driven systems, n8n automations, Dockerized services, and cloud-based workflows (GCP).  


## 🧭 Skills That Define Me 

✔ **Systematization & Systems Thinking**: Whether solving a tech challenge or analyzing a dataset, I approach problems with clarity and purpose.  
✔ **Rapid Learning & Adaptability**: From mastering new frameworks to quirky hobbies like touch-typing with ten fingers, I embrace learning as a lifelong process.  
✔ **Abstract Thinking**: Breaking down problems, identifying their core, and presenting insights in a clear, concise way is my strength.  
✔ **Self-Driven & Collaborative**: I thrive in remote environments, value autonomy, and am equally at home in team settings, where innovation flourishes.
